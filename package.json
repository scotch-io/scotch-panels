Scotch Panels are **featured-packed** and have a ton of different options for every skill-level to tweak and implement into almost any project. Scotch Panels work from **any** container so you can put your side navigation on any element you want. It even provides excellent backwards-compatible browser support via a JavaScript fallback. Lastly, there's over 30 stripped down code samples to get you up and running in no time.",
